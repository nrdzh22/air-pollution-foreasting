# Air Pollution Forecasting (Artificial Intelligence Model)

## 📋 Overview
**Project Name:🌍 Air Pollution Forecasting in Kuala Terengganu using Artificial Neural Networks**

This project leverages **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** to predict the **Air Pollution Index (API)** for Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia. The model is built using historical pollutant data over 5 years, including key air pollutants like **CO**, **O₃**, **SO₂**, **NO₂**, and **PM₁₀**. By forecasting air pollution levels, this project aims to assist in taking preventive measures for public health and environmental protection.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 **Data Collection**: Utilizes real-world air quality data from the **Department of Environment (DOE)** for Kuala Terengganu.
- 🔮 **Prediction Model**: Implements a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** Neural Network to predict API values.
- 🚀 **Performance**: Achieves a **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** of 0.0195, indicating strong predictive performance.
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive GUI for users to input pollutant data and retrieve air pollution predictions and status.
- 📊 **Prediction Categories**: Classifies the air quality into categories such as "Good," "Moderate," "Unhealthy," "Very Unhealthy," and "Hazardous" based on predicted API.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python**: Core programming language for model implementation.
- 🤖 **Keras**: Used for building the MLP Neural Network model.
- 💻 **Eclipse IDE**: Development environment for coding and debugging.
- 📊 **WEKA**: Tool used for data pre-processing (normalization, selection, and missing value handling).
- 📑 **Microsoft Excel**: To store input and output data used by the system.
